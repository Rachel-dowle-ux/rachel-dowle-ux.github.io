        <h2>Project overview</h2>
        
        <p>
            The Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme (ISCP) sets the national standards for surgical training in the UK. In 2021, 
            the curriculum underwent a major transformation, moving away from quantitative tick-box assessments toward a more holistic, qualitative framework.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As the UX and web designer on the ISCP curriculum team, I led the digital redesign of the curriculum’s online presence—shifting from static PDFs to accessible, 
            searchable web content. The project involved close collaboration with developers, designers, surgeons, and curriculum experts to ensure consistency across 12 surgical specialties and improve the user experience for trainees, trainers, and assessors.

    <h2>
        My process
    </h2>
    
    <h3>1.  Platform migration and functional planning</h3>
    <p>
        The existing CMS limited both functionality and content flexibility. 
        I collaborated with our in-house development team and a web design agency to migrate the site to Umbraco, which offered improved performance, search, and editorial capabilities. 
        I helped define functional requirements to support curriculum browsing, search, visual elements, and content updates.</p>
    
    <h3>2. UX strategy and side navigation design</h3>
    
    
    <p>
        A key challenge was helping users navigate thousands of lines of curriculum content. 
        I proposed and designed a new persistent side navigation system that allowed users to browse across sections and chapters within each surgical specialty. 
        This was designed with accessibility and scalability in mind and implemented by our development team with my input throughout.</p>

    <p>
        We also introduced fuzzy search functionality, making it easier to locate specific terms or outcomes, particularly for users already familiar with the material. 
    </p>    
    
            <h3>3. Content consistency across specialties</h3>
    <p>
        I worked directly with surgical leads for each of the 12 specialties to ensure their curriculum pages were consistent in tone, structure, and accessibility. 
        This included reformatting complex assessment details into readable web content and supporting the transition to narrative-style assessment descriptors.</p>


    <h3>4. SVG training pathways and visual cohesion</h3>
    
    <p>
        To illustrate surgical training progression in each specialty, I introduced the use of responsive SVG diagrams. 
        These allowed users to zoom, interact, and clearly follow their training routes—replacing static and inaccessible diagrams.</p>

    <p>
        To maintain visual cohesion across the site, I established a set of reusable SVG graphics and created a consistent iconography system. 
        I also worked with the design agency to develop an accessible colour palette that complemented ISCP’s identity and met WCAG guidelines.
    </p>    
    `
    <h3>5. Research-driven FAQ system</h3> 
    <p>
        To support both users and the customer service team, I researched design patterns from FAQs in complex digital products (e.g., government, banking, education sectors). 
        I then helped design a filterable, copy paste friendly FAQ section that was easy to update and aligned with ISCP’s voice. 
        This proved crucial in supporting users during the curriculum transition period.
    </p>
    
    <h3>6. UAT research and validation</h3>
    <p>
        I led a series of remote and in-person user acceptance testing (UAT) sessions with trainees, trainers, and stakeholders.         
        These sessions tested navigation, searchability, and overall comprehension. 
        Insights gained were directly applied to improve the content structure, visual design, and interaction patterns before final release.
    </p>
    
        <h2>
       Outcomes
        </h2>
    <p>
      The updated ISCP website successfully supported the rollout of the new, outcomes-based surgical curriculum, making complex content more accessible, navigable, and adaptable for both supervisors and trainees.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong>  The redesigned platform’s clear side navigation, search functionality, and semantic structure enable users to quickly find and understand key information (especially on mobile) reducing overwhelm and freeing up time for training conversations instead of administration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consistent, Scalable Design:</strong> Creating reusable components and iconography allows for ongoing updates and helps ISCP keep content accurate and adaptable alongside future curriculum tweaks.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Support for Outcomes-Based Training:</strong> The platform guides supervisors in assessing high-level capabilities (CiPs) and delivering actionable, meaningful feedback (MCRs), aligning with the new framework’s aim to foster competency and professional judgment.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Evaluation Highlights after first year (2021-2022)</strong> 
    </li>
<ul>
<li>
98% of trainees successfully transitioned to the new curriculum.
</li>
<li>
73% of midpoint reviews and 96% of final reviews were completed.
</li>
<li>
The evaluation revealed a strong need for additional training and support for supervisors and trainees, a consideration for future phases but there’s strong engagement and growing familiarity with the new framework across specialties.
</li>

</ul>

    </ul>
    <p>
        This project not only transformed how the ISCP curriculum is presented, but also demonstrated how UX, accessibility, and thoughtful design can improve the delivery of high-stakes professional information.
