    <h2>Project overview</h2>
    
    <p>
        The RYA Dinghy & Watersports Show is the UK’s leading event for sailing and watersports, attracting nearly 9,000 visitors and over 175 exhibitors in 2025.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As the lead UX designer and frontend developer, I led the design and build of the event microsite—creating an accessible, responsive, and visually engaging experience for a wide audience, from first-time visitors to experienced sailors.  </p>
    <p>
        Between 2023 and 2025, I iterated on the site each year, refining the user experience, visual design, and performance based on evolving goals and feedback.
    </p>

<h2>
    My process
</h2>
<p>
    When I joined the RYA, the Dinghy & Watersports Show was already a well-established annual event with several live web pages promoting the upcoming show. 
    
    However, the existing pages needed a review and redesign to better communicate the event’s purpose and improve the overall user experience.</p>

<h3>1. Internal stakeholder engagement and requirement capture</h3>
<p>
    To kick off the project, I led workshops and interviews with key internal teams—marketing, content, and events—to align on goals and understand audience needs. 
    This early discovery phase captured essential requirements around navigation, mobile responsiveness, and content flexibility. 
    The insights shaped a shared vision and laid the foundation for a user-friendly, scalable, and accessible event site.</p>

<h3>2. Market research and review of comparable events</h3>


<p>
    To inform the design direction, I conducted market research and analysed comparable watersports and outdoor exhibition websites. 
    This helped surface best practices in content layout, programme visibility, and ticketing flows. 
    Key takeaways—like simplifying navigation and prioritising “What’s On” content—shaped early design decisions and ensured we met user expectations for a modern event experience.</p>

<h3>3. co-design workshop with initial mock-up</h3>
<p>
    I ran a co-design workshop with internal stakeholders to present early mock-ups and walk teams through the proposed design approach. 
    This session helped secure buy-in, clarify outstanding content needs, and build strong relationships across teams. 
    It also helped stakeholders feel part of the process, making collaboration smoother throughout the project.</p>
     
<h3>4. Wireframing in figma and iterative UX refinement</h3>

<p>
    Based on early feedback and research, I created low- to mid-fidelity wireframes in Figma to define layout, navigation, and mobile behaviour. 
    I shared these with internal teams to gather feedback on content clarity, user flow, and usability. 
    This collaborative, iterative approach helped refine the design before handoff to development—ensuring it was intuitive, on-brand, and aligned with both user and business needs.</p>

<h3>5. Modular design system</h3> 
<p>
    To support consistency and streamline development, I established a lightweight modular design system in Figma. 
    I created reusable components—such as event cards, CTA blocks, and FAQ panels—anchored in shared styles, spacing, and colour rules. 
    These elements, developed in collaboration with the brand and marketing teams, ensured visual cohesion and provided a foundation for both design and build.  
</p>

<h3>6. Build and cross-team implementation</h3>
<p>
    I coded the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, applying the design system across key page templates and integrating small graphical elements 
    like custom buttons, typography, and colour accents. I collaborated closely with the brand and marketing teams to compile all visual assets—graphics, 
    photography, exhibitor logos, and video content—ensuring they were correctly formatted and on-brand. While the events team provided the programme 
    information and the marketing team produced written content, I also worked with our SEO consultant and social media executive to optimise the site and support promotion. 
    This hands-on, cross-functional approach helped deliver a polished, performance-ready site tailored for both user experience and discoverability. 
</p>

<h2>
    Engagement (2024 - 2025)

<p>A total of around 35,000 views was acquired by our main Dinghy Show landing page from 01 October 2024 to 28 Feb 2025. </p>
